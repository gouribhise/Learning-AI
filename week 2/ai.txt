Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field that empowers machines to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence like learning from data, pattern recognition, decision-making—all while minimizing direct human input. Common applications are in voice assistants, recommendation systems, and smart devices; industries leverage AI for automation, efficiency improvements, reducing errors. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques propel modern AI forward by rapidly analyzing vast data volumes beyond human capabilities—improving healthcare diagnostics and personalized treatments while advancing autonomous vehicles in transportation management; however, ethical concerns about privacy, bias, job displacement remain pertinent. As the technology continues to evolve, its potential impact on transforming how we live, work, and interact with machines is undeniable (ai.txt)
